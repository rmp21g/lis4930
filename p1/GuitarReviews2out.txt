1|BenderCaster|My new favorite guitar|I’ve been playing the Wes Hall for many years, but finally decided to buy this Bender Caster.  My Wes has terrific sustain, but the Caster gives me a funky sound I love!  The maple neck is terrific too.  Would highly recommend this guitar!
2|BenderCaster|Good but not Great|The Bender Caster sounds clean, the 3-position switch gives a good variety of tones.  Note bending can through the tuning out though.  If you are considering the Caster, I would pick the hard tail option.  The tuning pegs have some play, this was disappointing.  Overall a good guitar but could be improved.
3|BenderCaster|Try before buying|I tried the Caster in my local music store and was impressed.  To save some $s I ordered online and the guitar came in a day (great) but was not as playable as the one in the store.  I’ve decided to return it and buy locally.
4|BenderCaster|Love It!|Everything about the Bender Caster met or exceeded my expectations.  Highly playable, great tone, sounds great through my Triple Echo amp.  The starburst looks great.  Highly recommend!
5|BenderCaster|Great Guitar, Great Price|I’ve been playing Bender guitars for years, this is my 3rd Caster.  Plays great, the action is just right - playable with no buzz.  Versatile too - sounds great for blues, rock, even jazz.  Very affordable too - in my opinion sounds as good has guitars costing two or more times.
6|WesHall|Amazing Guitar|I’ve been playing an entry level guitar for years but finally decided to treat myself to the Wes Hall.  Now I’m sorry I waited!  The guitar looks amazing and plays terrific.  The sustain is like forever - without any pedals.  Only drawback - it’s heavy, so if you’re playing a long gig, keep that in mind :-)
7|WesHall|None better|The Wes Hall is THE GUITAR for rock & roll.  I know other people prefer the Bender but if you’re into hard rock, the Wes is the best.  Terrific tone and sustain, low action for incredible playability.  The pickups deliver great sound with almost no noise.
8|WesHall|Great Choice|I’ve been playing guitar occasionally but now with the Wes Hall I’m playing every day and loving it.  The guitar sounds great - I can get the tone and feel of so many of the songs I love.  Sounds unbelievable with my Earsplit 200 tube amp.
9|WesHall|Good Guitar but Pricey|I was excited to order the Wes but given the price I’ve been disappointed.  I chose the road-worn option, but it just looks used.  The action on the strings is too low - I need to get it set up to avoid buzz.  The neck is ok but wide for my taste.  Overall ok but disappointing.  May reconsider and go with the Bender.
10|WesHall|It’s it|Unbelievable!  It’s the classic, the original.  Nothing more to say
