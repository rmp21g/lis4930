" coach slocum and i made the decision to be a part of this exciting venture with espn , " texas a & m athletics director wally groff said . " we couldn ' t be more thrilled that espn has chosen texas a & m for this series . the opportunity espn gave us to showcase this wonderful institution and all of its tradition and heritage is something we could not pass up . " in a " docu - drama " style , the various stories that surround the team will be explored through the voices and actions of people whose day - to - day lives are directly affected by living in the town and / or going to the school . players and coaches will also be visible and heard from in a more peripheral fashion , but will not be the primary focus . " this is a good opportunity for texas a & m university and we ' re delighted espn decided to feature the football program and some of the people behind the scenes , " head coach r . c . slocum said . " we look forward to working with them . " the participants will be drawn from a cross section of people who reflect every aspect of the university and college station , texas . they will be students , faculty , media , local storeowners , mothers , fathers and some of the high school seniors who aspire to attend the university . " each person has a role to play with the team , as well as a personal story , " said mark shapiro , vice president and general manager , espn original entertainment . " sidelines will see each person grow in character as the season progresses - - a kind of ' soap - umentary .

" sidelines : texas a & m storylines - - this is the 125 th anniversary of the school ' s founding ( 1876 ) . - - the community is still very much dealing with the 1999 bonfire collapse which tragically killed 12 students almost two years ago . a 90 - year tradition came to a tumultuous end . dealing with the loss and the emotional toll it took on faculty members , students and families will be an important part of this series . the bonfire will return in 2002 but will take on a different form than has been tradition . - - texas a & m , who lost a wild , snowy independence bowl last year in overtime to mississippi state 43 - 41 , will play notre dame ( at home ) , texas , oklahoma , kansas st and colorado next year . a tough schedule will provide for great drama . - - the school invented the phrase " 12 th man " and actually owns the trademark . one game , the aggies were low on players and had a student suit up and stand ready just in case he was needed . ever since , a student is chosen for every home game to suit up and play on the kickoff team . - - billy pickard is in charge of maintaining the facilities . he ' s been at the university for 36 years and was the student trainer for bear bryant ' s a & m team . he was actually in junction , texas for bryant ' s infamous grueling summer camp . the story of it was a best - selling book , the junction boys . - - at midnight on the friday night before every home game , a " 30 , 000 fans show up each week for this time - honored tradition . eoe , the newest franchise of espn programming , will develop a wide - variety of branded programming outside of the network ' s traditional event and sports news genres . using a collection of vehicles - - game shows , documentaries or reality - based shows - it ' s espn ' s goal to broaden its audience by appealing to younger and casual sports fans . in addition , the company is exploring new ways to connect with consumers by applying these projects across all platforms of the espn family - television , internet , radio - atm -

( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ?

" some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - i assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems ( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal . before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with their pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the unify team . there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im market east - but not from ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity . " warning - not the same legal entity " also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by thomas engel / hou / ect on 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 47 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : scott mills on 04 / 04 / 2000 07 : 38 pm to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect cc : steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect , thomas engel / hou / ect @ ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) . in addition , this release will also capture " near - time " the contract changes that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be necessary . new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager . new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) . once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you are looking for will appear . i mention " near - time " because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then updates its information srm ( x 33548 ) cyndie balfour - flanagan @ enron 04 / 04 / 2000 03 : 41 pm to : connie sutton / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , richard elwood / hou / ect @ ect , dave nommensen / hou / ect @ ect , kenneth m harmon / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , gayle horn / corp / enron @ enron , brant reves / hou / ect @ ect , russell diamond / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect , steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : changes in global due to consent to assignment the following changes will be made in the global contracts database due to receipt of executed consent to assignment for the following contracts : current counterparty name contract type contract # ' new ' counterparty name ces - commonwealth energy services gisb 96029892 commonwealth energy services ces - samuel gary jr . & associates , inc gisb 96029302 samuel gary jr . & associates ces - south jersey gas company gisb 96029143 south jersey gas company cp name change and contract type correction ( contract type different than that provided by ces ) per ces ces - southwest gas corporation 1 / 1 / 98 gisb 96029146 per contract file ces - southwest gas corporation 04 / 14 / 93 master purchase / sale interruptible ( will edit global # 96029146 ) & ces - southwest gas corporation 12 / 01 / 94 master sale firm ( created new global record to accommodate this k , # 96037402 ) please note that southwest gas corporation has consented to the assignment of both of these contracts .

" i see no compelling reason at this time ; there have been no complaints and no evidence . " she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction . " i agree with concept philosophically , but i think there will be other opportunities later on , after we do a little more bridge - building with state commissions . " wood said he understood " the political issue here with respect to federal - state relations , but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated . " staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems , waivers could be granted . staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel . " if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load , i can go into the control room and get all the information i want , " one staffer responded . wood proposed , and the commissioners ratified , a proposed rule with no exceptions , but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required . commenting parties should provide cost / benefit analysis on both sides of the question . state commissions are also invited to comment . wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees , " but make it clear that if we don ' t hear from people that they really want this separation , we ain ' t going to do it .
